Same as [k5_v2.01.19_mod.bin](https://github.com/Tunas1337/UV-K5-Modded-Firmwares/blob/main/k5_v2.01.19_mod.md), but allows transmission between 50 and 850 MHz.

# WARNING WARNING WARNING
PLEASE do not blame me if you burn the finals on your radio, or cause a thermonuclear war. This modification is *UNTESTED* and is for *RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY*, to explore the capabilities of the device and its chipset.
DO NOT transmit on illegal frequencies. DO use a dummy load. DO report results, preferably spectrum analyzer screenshots, to this repo for research.
