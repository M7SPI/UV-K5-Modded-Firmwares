# UV-K5-Modded-Firmwares
A collection of modified firmwares for the Quansheng UV-K5 radio.

So far, there is two firmwares, one modified by me and one by [@amnemonic.](https://github.com/amnemonic) The new features so far include, but are not limited to:
- Regular (FM) reception from 18-850MHz
- AM reception from 18-136MHz

* **Warning:** The Quansheng UV-K5 CAN NOT receive signals between 630-840MHz. This is a hardware limitation of the Beken BK4819 baseband chip. Please do not open issues about this, it is impossible to fix in software.
