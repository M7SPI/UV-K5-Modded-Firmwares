# UV-K5-Modded-Firmwares
A collection of modified firmwares for the Quansheng UV-K5 radio.

This repository contains several firmwares, modified by:
- [@amnemonic](https://github.com/amnemonic)
- [@fagci](https://github.com/fagci)
- [@Tunas1337](https://github.com/Tunas1337)

The new features so far include, but are not limited to:
- Regular (FM) reception from 18-850MHz (1300MHz with the extended mod)
- AM reception from 18-136MHz (850MHz with the extended mod)
- Transmission outside of the 136-174,400-520MHz bands

* **Warning:** The Quansheng UV-K5 CAN NOT receive signals between 630-840MHz. This is a hardware limitation of the Beken BK4819 baseband chip. Please do not open issues about this, it is impossible to fix in software.
