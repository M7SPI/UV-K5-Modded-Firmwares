# UV-K5-Modded-Firmwares
A collection of modified firmwares for the Quansheng UV-K5 radio.

So far, there is only one firmware, modified by me. The new features include, but are not limited to:
- Regular (FM) reception from 18-850MHz
- AM reception from 18-136MHz (I am 99% sure it can go higher, but that's for the next mod.)
- PONMSG FULL now shows stripes :)
