Practically the same as [the other one](https://github.com/Tunas1337/UV-K5-Modded-Firmwares/blob/main/k5_v2.01.19_mod.md), but the AM range (F2) is expanded from 18MHz to 850MHz.
I wouldn't recommend using this one unless you need the extended AM range, because the band expansion messes with having different VFO memories for each band (if you input a frequency, it'll always be in F2, and you cannot change the VFO frequency of the other bands.)
